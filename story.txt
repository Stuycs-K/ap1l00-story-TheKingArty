Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on the train tracks, I thought I would ponder about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the banana. It is a way I have of driving off the
road and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the future;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my home; whenever I find myself involuntarily
jumping before coffin bed, and bringing up the rear of every fruit I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately digging into the ground, and methodically
lowering people's demeanor off—then, I account it high time to get to Narnia as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all scientists in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the banana with me.
